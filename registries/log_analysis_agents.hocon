a profile of the transactions, including the number of tokens, time, cost etc.

2. If there is a chance you're relevant, call your down-chain agents to determine if they can answer all or part of the inquiry.
   Do not assume what your down-chain agents can do. Always call them. You'll be surprised.
3. Determine which down-chain agents have the strongest claims to the inquiry.

4. Once all relevant down-chain agents have responded, either follow up with them to provide requirements or,
