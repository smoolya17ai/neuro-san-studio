        # These tool definitions do not have to be in any particular order
        # How they are linked and call each other is defined within their
        # own specs.  This could be a graph, potentially even with cycles.

        # This first agent definition is regarded as the "Front Man", which
        # does all the talking to the outside world/client.
        # It is identified as such because it is either:
        #   A) The only one with no parameters in his function definition,
        #      and therefore he needs to talk to the outside world to get things rolling.
        #   B) The first agent listed, regardless of function parameters.
        #
        # Some disqualifications from being a front man:
        #   1) Cannot use a CodedTool "class" definition
        #   2) Cannot use a Tool "toolbox" definition
