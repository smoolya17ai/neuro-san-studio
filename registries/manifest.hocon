    # Demos

    # This agent network performs the following actions:
    # 1. Calls "agent_network_designer" as an external agent to generate a .hocon configuration file.
    # 2. Uses the "agent_network_html_generator" tool (from the toolbox) to create an HTML visualization of the network.
    # 3. Demonstrates how the generated network works by calling the coded tool "NsflowSelenium".
    # 4. Sends an email with the .hocon and HTML files attached using the "gmail_with_attachment" tool (also from the toolbox).
    #
    # Requirements:
    # - Install Gmail support:
    #     pip install -U langchain-google-community[gmail]
    # - Set up Gmail API credentials:
    #     Follow the instructions at
    #     https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/quickstart/python#authorize_credentials_for_a_desktop_application
    #     Then download the `credentials.json` file and place it at the top level of this repo.
    # - Install Selenium and WebDriver Manager:
    #     pip install selenium webdriver-manager
    #
    # Additional setup for running the "NsflowSelenium" coded tool:
    # - Start the nsflow service in a separate terminal.
    # - Use non-default ports for the neuro-san gRPC, HTTP, and nsflow servers.
    #   The default ports (30011 for gRPC, 8080 for HTTP, and 4173 for nsflow) must be changed.
    #   For example, you can run:
    #     python -m run --server-grpc-port 30012 --server-http-port 8081 --nsflow-port 4174
