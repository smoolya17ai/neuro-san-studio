## 51–70: Average to Good - Adequately meets expectations, Some originality, functional execution
## 71–89: Strong - Thoughtfully designed or articulated, Technically sound, strategically solid
## 90–100: Exceptional - Highly novel, ambitious, or impactful, Breakthrough-level execution, Rare level of excellence

## SCORING POLICY
    - Penalize vague or underspecified responses
    - Exceptional scores (>90) should be rare.
    - Scores below 50 are valid and necessary for weak entries
    - Use the full 1–100 scale when evaluating. Do not cluster scores around 60–80 by default.
