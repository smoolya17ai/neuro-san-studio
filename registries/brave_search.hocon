# To use this agent network with Brave Search, obtain an API key from: https://brave.com/search/api/
# Once you have the API key, set it using the BRAVE_API_KEY environment variable.
# You can optionally set a custom search URL via the BRAVE_URL environment variable.
# If BRAVE_URL is not set, the default is: https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=
# You can also configure the request timeout (in seconds) using BRAVE_TIMEOUT; the default is 30 seconds.

        # These tool definitions do not have to be in any particular order
        # How they are linked and call each other is defined within their
        # own specs.  This could be a graph, potentially even with cycles.

        # This first agent definition is regarded as the "Front Man", which
        # does all the talking to the outside world/client.
        # It is identified as such because it is either:
        #   A) The only one with no parameters in his function definition,
        #      and therefore he needs to talk to the outside world to get things rolling.
        #   B) The first agent listed, regardless of function parameters.
        #
        # Some disqualifications from being a front man:
        #   1) Cannot use a CodedTool "class" definition
        #   2) Cannot use a Tool "toolbox" definition
