                to the coded tool and whose values are the values passed for them
                by the calling agent. This dictionary is to be treated as read-only.

                The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                    "start_date" the start date of the leave;

                This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
                It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
                yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
                for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
                by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
                adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.

                Keys expected for this implementation are:
                    "login" The user id describing who is making the request.
