            hierarchy, but whose values are meant to be kept out of the
            chat stream.

            This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
            It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
            yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
            for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
            by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool implementation
            adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than once.

            Keys expected for this implementation are:
