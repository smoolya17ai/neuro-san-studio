# Agent Network Designer

The **Agent Network Designer** is a multi-agent system for creating multi-agent systems. Give the top agent the name of an organization or describe a use-case, and it will design a multi-agent system and save it into your registries directory in hocon format, and add it to your manifest file. It will also give you a few usage examples. Restart your server and client, and use the new agent network!

**Note**: this demo will add a file to your directory and modify your manifest.hocon file. You can turn this feature off by changing WRITE_TO_FILE to False in [get_agent_network_hocon.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/get_agent_network_hocon.py)

## File

[agent_network_designer.hocon](../../registries/agent_network_designer.hocon)

## Description

This network follows a relatively rigid set of steps, with the top-level "front-man" agent giving a design request to the network_generator, then having the instruction_refiner agent refine the instructions of every agent one by one, then the top agent has the query_generator agent return some example usage queries for the new agent network, and finally, the produce_agent_network_hocon agent creates the hocon definition, appends the header, and saves it to file.

This can be considered as an example of agent-oriented software, with a clear delineation of where we need to rely on LLMs (e.g., for creativity, language understanding, language generation) and where we should use code (e.g., to encode machine readable syntax such as is needed in a hocon agent definition file).

Note the use of sly_data in the coded tools for storing and passing around the agent network data structure. Agents use coded tools for adding agents to this data structure, or for refining the description of a specific agent.

📋
Here are 3-4 sample queries illustrating the usage of the UNHCR back-office agent network:

"Can you provide a financial report for the last quarter and identify any areas where we might improve our budgeting?"

"What is the current status of the recruitment process for the new field officers? How many positions are still open?"

"Please ensure that the payroll is processed on time this month and check if there are any discrepancies from last month."

"We need to procure tents and emergency supplies for the upcoming refugee camp setup. Can you coordinate this with the supply chain and contract specialists?"
```

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: **agent_network_designer**
- Acts as the entry point for all user commands.
- Follows a set of steps to design, construct, and refine an agent network hocon.
- Once the agent network is designed and the instructions for every agent is refined, calls [get_agent_network_hocon.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/get_agent_network_hocon.py) to generate the hocon formatted definition.
- Calls the query_generator agent to produce a few usage ea=xamples for the new agent network. 
- Returns the hocon definition as well as a few example queries.

### Agents called by the Frontman:

1. **network_generator**
   - Designs an agent network by determining the top agent, its down-chain agents, and their down-chain agents, if needed.
   - Calls the add_agent_to_network agent repeatedly in order to add each agent, the list of the agent's down-chains, and the agent's preliminary instructions to the agent definition data structure stored in sly_data.
   - See [add_agent.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/add_agent.py)

2. **instruction_refiner**
   - Retrieves the agent network definition using the [get_agent_network.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/get_agent_network.py) tool.
   - Iterates through the agents in the retrieved definition and refines each agent's instructions using the [set_agent_instructions.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/set_agent_instructions.py) tool

3. **query_generator**
   - Retrieves the agent network definition using the [get_agent_network.py](../../coded_tools/agent_network_designer/get_agent_network.py) tool.
   - Generates and returns a few usage examples for the new agent network.

---

## Functional Tools

These are coded tools called by various policy agents:

- **add_agent**
  - Adds the name, instructions, and list of down-chains of an agent to a data structure stored in sly_data. It also determines of the agent is the top agent.

- **get_agent_network**
  - Retrieves the agent network data structure from sly_data and returns a string representation of it.

- **set_agent_instructions**
  - Replaces the instructions for a given agent in the list of agents in the agent network data structure in sly_data.

- **get_agent_network_hocon**
  - Retrieves the agent network data structure from sly_data.
  - Formats the agent network as a hocon definition config.
  - Appends a header.
  - Saves the hocon file under the local registries directory.
  - Adds an entry to the local manifest.hocon file.

**Note**: it is assumed that the agent coordination mechanism is AAOSA, and the LLM is GPT-4o.

---

## Debugging Hints

- While the hocon definition returned by the top agent may occasionally be incomplete or have errors, the hocon file stored in the registries directory will be complete and error free.
